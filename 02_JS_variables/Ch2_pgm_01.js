// Declaring a variable

var score;

/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Delete the semicolon at after the word score.
 *    JS Bin should complain and show an error message.
 *    Take a look at the message.
 *
 * 2) Add the semicolon back after the word score.
 *    The semicolon shows the end of the statement.
 *
 * 3) Declare two more variables.

// Attempting to delete the semicolon would result in an error:
// SyntaxError: Unexpected token 'score'

// Add the semicolon back after the word score
var score;

// Declare two more variables
var playerName;
var level;

// Now we have three variables declared: score, playerName, and level
